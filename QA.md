# Questions and answers

### Will you add OpenAI / Claude / Gemini or any other provider support?

Nope. Going to strictly be Ollama only or any other local only solution. The reasoning is I refuse to make it easier for people to open up their financial records to the internet.

### How do i set up MySQL?

If you don't understand how to do this, you best stick to local file storage only. It is for advanced users only, especially since they need to understand security with it. I do recommend a raspberry pi for storage and backups though!

## Why do you not accept public contributions?

I do not have the time to handle code reviews, and I want security of the app to be a prime focus. It's easier for me to take feature requests, implement them myself then release.

It's the AI age, you can recreate the app if you wish in a week.
